Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

### 2. COMMONS CLAUSE LIMITATION

The MIT License permissions granted above are subject to the following restrictions:

Without limiting other conditions in this License, the grant of rights under this License will not include, and the License does not grant to you, the right to Sell the Software or to provide the Software as a part of a hosted, managed service, or online service where the primary value of such service is the availability of the Software.

For purposes of the foregoing:

"Sell" means practicing any or all of the rights granted to you under the License to provide to third parties, for a fee or other consideration (including without limitation fees for hosting, consulting, support, or managed services, or receiving revenue from advertising displayed within the Software), a product or service whose value derives, entirely or substantially, from the functionality of the Software.

This restriction does not apply to:
1. Individual developers or small businesses with annual gross revenue under US $1,000,000
2. Non-profit organizations and educational institutions
3. Internal use within an organization, regardless of size, where the Software is not part of a service offered to external customers

### 3. TRADEMARK AND ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

In addition to the terms and conditions above, all uses of the Software are subject to the following attribution requirements:

a) All copies of the Software in Executable and Source Code form must include on each user interface screen the "powered by Mixcore CMS" text, which must be:
   i. Visible to all users
   ii. Appear in each user interface screen
   iii. Maintain consistent positioning across the application
   iv. Be clearly legible with reasonable contrast against its background

b) When users click on the "powered by Mixcore CMS" text, they must be directed to https://www.mixcore.org

c) The Mixcore name and logo are trademarks of Mixcore and may only be used in the required attribution and may not be used to promote or endorse derivative products without explicit written permission.

### 4. REVENUE TIER EXEMPTIONS

The restrictions in Section 2 (Commons Clause Limitation) and Section 3 (Trademark and Attribution Requirements) are automatically adjusted based on the annual gross revenue of the entity using the Software as follows:

a) **Tier 1: Under US $1,000,000 annual gross revenue**
   - Exempt from Commons Clause limitations
   - Must comply with attribution requirements

b) **Tier 2: US $1,000,000 to $10,000,000 annual gross revenue**
   - Subject to Commons Clause limitations
   - Must comply with attribution requirements
   - May obtain exemptions through Commercial License options

c) **Tier 3: Over US $10,000,000 annual gross revenue**
   - Subject to Commons Clause limitations
   - Must comply with attribution requirements
   - Commercial License required for any exemptions

### 5. GEOGRAPHICAL ADJUSTMENTS

The revenue tiers specified in Section 4 are adjusted based on location to account for economic differences across regions:

a) **High-income economies** (as defined by the World Bank): 100% of the stated thresholds

b) **Upper-middle-income economies**: 60% of the stated thresholds

c) **Lower-middle-income economies**: 30% of the stated thresholds

d) **Low-income economies**: 10% of the stated thresholds

The current classification of economies can be found on the World Bank website. The applicable classification at the time of initial Software acquisition applies for the duration of use unless a Commercial License specifies otherwise.

### 6. COMMERCIAL LICENSE OPTION

Entities wishing to be exempt from the Commons Clause limitations and/or the Trademark and Attribution Requirements may purchase a Commercial License from Mixcore. A Commercial License grants additional rights beyond this License and supersedes the restrictions in Sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 according to its terms.

### 7. TERMINATION

This License automatically terminates if you fail to comply with any of its terms or conditions. Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of the Software in your possession.

### 8. ATTRIBUTION LICENSE

If you wish to be exempt solely from the attribution requirements in Section 3 while remaining subject to the Commons Clause in Section 2, you may purchase an Attribution License at a lower cost than a full Commercial License. Visit the Mixcore website for details.

### 9. CONTRIBUTION

Any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Software shall be subject to this License without any additional terms or conditions.
