# RXJS

RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. RxJS Overview

In RxJS and in reactive programming in general, the fundamental unit of work is the stream. Think in terms of streams (think reactively) and design code in a way that, instead of holding on to data, you allow it to flow through and apply transformations along the way until it reaches your desired state. RxJS in Action
